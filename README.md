# InferShield 🛡️

**Open-source security for LLM inference — detect threats, block PII, audit everything.**

InferShield is a self-hosted security platform that protects your AI applications from prompt injection, data exfiltration, and PII leaks. Works with any LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, local models) through a drop-in proxy, browser extension, or direct API integration.

## What is InferShield?

InferShield provides enterprise-grade security for LLM applications through **three integrated components**:

🧩 **Browser Extension** — Intercept and analyze LLM requests from any web app (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)  
📡 **Security Proxy** — Drop-in OpenAI-compatible proxy for server-side protection (any language/framework)  
🖥️ **Self-Serve Platform** — User accounts, API key management, usage tracking, and real-time monitoring dashboard

**Current Status:**
- ✅ **Platform v0.7.0** — Production-ready with authentication, API keys, PII detection, and quota management
- ✅ **Proxy v0.8.1** — Verified on Windows and Linux with advanced threat detection (< 1ms latency)
- ⏳ **Chrome Extension v1.0** — Submitted to Chrome Web Store (pending review, ~7 days)

---

## Quick Start

### 🧩 Option 1: Browser Extension (Chrome)

**Status:** Pending Chrome Web Store review (available ~March 1, 2026)

Once approved:
1. Install from Chrome Web Store
2. Sign up for free account (100 requests/month)
3. Browse ChatGPT, Claude, or any LLM web interface
4. View real-time threat detection in extension popup

**Early Access:** Email hello@infershield.io for developer build.

### 📡 Option 2: Security Proxy (Developers)

**Windows:**

```powershell
# Download the latest release
curl -o infershield-proxy.exe https://github.com/InferShield/infershield/releases/latest/download/infershield-proxy-windows.exe

# Run the proxy (add your OpenAI key)
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
.\infershield-proxy.exe

# Proxy running at http://localhost:8000
```

**Mac/Linux:**

```bash
# Clone and run via Docker
git clone https://github.com/InferShield/infershield.git
cd infershield
docker-compose up -d

# Or run directly with Node.js
cd proxy
npm install
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here npm start
```

**Update your code (one line):**

```python
# Before:
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

# After:
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1")
```

Now visit:
- **Dashboard:** http://localhost:3000
- **API:** http://localhost:5000

## Security Model

### What InferShield Protects Against

- ✅ **Prompt Injection** — Detects attempts to override system instructions
- ✅ **Data Exfiltration** — Blocks requests trying to extract sensitive data
- ✅ **PII Leakage** — Identifies 15+ types of personally identifiable information (SSN, credit cards, emails, etc.)
- ✅ **Jailbreak Attempts** — Catches evasion techniques (encoding, obfuscation, role-play attacks)
- ✅ **SQL Injection** — Prevents database attack patterns in prompts
- ✅ **Secrets Exposure** — Detects API keys, passwords, tokens in requests

### What Data is Logged

**Logged by default:**
- Request metadata (timestamp, user ID, API key ID, model, risk score)
- Prompt text (for threat analysis)
- Response text (for threat analysis)
- Detected threats and policy violations

**NOT logged:**
- User passwords (stored as bcrypt hashes only)
- API keys in plaintext (stored as bcrypt hashes only)
- Payment information (handled by Stripe)

**PII Redaction:** Optionally enable automatic PII redaction in logs (SSN, credit cards, etc. replaced with `[REDACTED]`). See [Configuration Guide](./docs/QUICKSTART.md).

### Blocked Requests

When a high-risk request is detected (configurable threshold, default ≥80):
- ❌ Request is **blocked before reaching the LLM provider**
- 📊 Full request details logged for forensic analysis
- 🔔 API key owner notified (if configured)
- 🚫 User receives error response with risk explanation

**Self-hosted = Your data never leaves your infrastructure.**
