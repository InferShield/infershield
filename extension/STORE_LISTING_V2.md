# Stop AI Data Leaks Before They Happen

**InferShield** provides real-time privacy scanning for your AI chat conversations. Catch accidental leaks of API keys, credentials, and personal information before you hit send.

## 🛡️ How InferShield Protects You

**1. Real-Time Scanning**
Every message you type in ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or GitHub Copilot is scanned **before it leaves your browser**. InferShield detects 15+ types of sensitive data including:

✓ API Keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
✓ OAuth Tokens & JWT Tokens
✓ Database Connection Strings
✓ Email Addresses & Phone Numbers
✓ Social Security Numbers
✓ Credit Card Numbers
✓ IP Addresses & MAC Addresses
✓ Dates of Birth & Passport Numbers
✓ Driver's Licenses
✓ Medical Record Numbers
✓ And more...

**2. Instant Alerts**
If InferShield detects sensitive data, you see a modal **before sending** with:
- **Risk Score** (0-100, based on severity)
- **Threat Types** (e.g., "OpenAI API Key Detected")
- **Three Options:**
  - ❌ **Cancel** — Don't send the message
  - 🔒 **Redact & Send** — Automatically mask sensitive data
  - ⚠️ **Send Anyway** — Proceed with full context (your choice)

**3. No Interruption for Safe Messages**
Messages with no threats send normally — zero delay, zero friction. InferShield only interrupts when it matters.

## 💡 Why You Need This

**Did you know?**
- AI chat logs may be reviewed by human trainers
- Your conversations are stored for months (or longer)
- Once you send, you can't unsend

**Common Mistakes We Prevent:**
❌ Copy-pasting code snippets with API keys
❌ Sharing debugging logs containing credentials
❌ Asking AI to help with config files that have secrets
❌ Pasting error messages with sensitive IPs or tokens
❌ Accidentally including personal info in prompts

**With InferShield:**
✅ Get a warning **before** it's too late
✅ Automatically redact sensitive data
✅ Stay in control of what you share

## 🚨 Important Disclaimer

InferShield helps detect common PII and credential patterns but **is not 100% foolproof**. Always:
- Review what you share with AI systems
- Follow your organization's security policies
- For regulated industries (healthcare, finance), consult your compliance team

InferShield is a **defense-in-depth tool** — use it as part of a broader security strategy.

## Permission Justifications (For Chrome Review)

**storage:**
```
Store user settings including API endpoint URL, API key, enabled platforms (ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/Copilot), and protection mode preferences (Block/Warn). This allows your configuration to persist across browser sessions without requiring re-authentication.
```

**activeTab:**
```
Detect when you're on a supported AI chat platform (chat.openai.com, claude.ai, gemini.google.com, or github.com/copilot) to activate InferShield's real-time scanning. We only access the active tab when you're on a supported site. InferShield does not monitor tabs you're not actively using.
```

**host_permissions (chat.openai.com, claude.ai, gemini.google.com, github.com):**
```
Inject our content script into supported AI chat platforms to scan messages in real-time before you send them. InferShield only works on the platforms you explicitly enable in extension settings. We do not access any other websites or track your browsing activity. Our content script runs only on these four domains to provide AI chat protection.
```
