# Never Accidentally Share Secrets with AI Again

InferShield protects you from accidentally sharing sensitive information with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and GitHub Copilot.

## 🛡️ What InferShield Does

**Real-Time Protection:**
Before you send any message to an AI chat, InferShield scans it for sensitive data and alerts you if threats are found. You choose what to do next: Cancel, Redact, or Send Anyway.

**15+ Threat Types Detected:**
✓ API Keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub, AWS, Generic)
✓ Authentication Tokens
✓ Email Addresses
✓ Social Security Numbers
✓ Credit Card Numbers
✓ Phone Numbers
✓ IP Addresses
✓ Dates of Birth
✓ Passport Numbers
✓ Driver's Licenses
✓ Medical Record Numbers
✓ And more!

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **You type** a message in ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or GitHub Copilot
2. **You hit Send** — InferShield intercepts the message
3. **Instant scan** (< 100ms) checks for PII and sensitive data
4. **If threats detected**, a modal appears showing:
   - Risk score (0-100)
   - Threat types found (e.g., "API Key", "Email Address")
   - Three options: **Cancel | Redact & Send | Send Anyway**
5. **You choose** what to do
6. **InferShield executes** your choice

**No threats detected?** Your message sends normally — no interruption!
